<h2>---About Me---</h2>
Hello,
my name is Sead Silajdzic. I live in Kljuc, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have successfully finished the IT Academy and currently, I am working as a certified PHP developer and freelance web developer. My main passion is, of course, back-end programming but I don't have any problems with front-end, either.

Technologies I am familiar with:
<ul>
<li>PHP (Laravel)</li>
<li>MySql</li>
<li>HTML 5</li>
<li>CSS 3 (Sass and Less)</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

Available for employment ☑


<h2>---About Project---</h2>
This project is including all basic parts of every website and I decided to upload it here so You can see mine whole progress while I made this site work. I have included all basic and some more advanced stuff that most of the sites need in production. All future updates will also be uploaded here and marked so new developers can use this site as a guide on how to create one nice and functional site.

I hope You will like it :) <br> <br>
Thanks for Your time

<h2>---Future plans and projects---</h2>
In the nearest future, my goal is to advertise myself much more over social media, publish more sites on my Github account (just designs without any other technologies in the background and designed sites with PHP background) and as the main goal for this year will be creating a platform for a small online community ⛄.
Also one of my main priorities will be improving my JavaScript skills in terms of web design.
